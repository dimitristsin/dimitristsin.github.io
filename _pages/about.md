# Dimitrios Tsintsilidas  
*PhD Student Â· University of Warwick*

---

Hi, my name is **Dimitrios Tsintsilidas**!  

I am a first-year PhD student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Warwick. I am a member of the Theory and Foundations [(FoCS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/) group and the Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications [(DIMAP)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Igor Carboni Oliveira](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~igorcarb/) and [Christian Ikenmeyer](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u2270030/). My research is supported by the [Chancellors' International Scholarship](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/scholarships_and_funding/cis/).

Previously, I was a Master's student at the Department of Mathematics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I studied Pure Mathematics. My specialisation was in Algebra and Logic and I was advised by [Chrysostomos Psaroudakis](https://sites.google.com/view/chrysostomos-psaroudakis/home). I received my undergraduate degree (Diploma) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the same university. I pursued my Diploma Thesis on Quantum Cryptography in Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6 (LIP6) of the CNRS and Sorbonne University, where I was supervised by [Alex Bredariol Grilo](https://abgrilo.github.io/).

## Research Interests

My research is primarily focused on computational complexity theory and its connections with algebra and logic. Specifically in algebra, I investigate the use of representation theory for proving lower bounds in algebraic/geometric complexity theory, and regarding logic, I am interested in formalising complexity theory in bounded arithmetic, as well as proving independence results.
