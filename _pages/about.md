Hi, my name is Dimitrios Tsintsilidas! 

I am a first year PhD student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Warwick. I am a member of the Theory and Foundations[(FoCS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/) group and the Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications [(DIMAP)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Igor Carboni Oliveira](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~igorcarb/) and [Christian Ikenmeyer](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u2270030/). My research is supported by the [Chancellor's International Scholarship](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/scholarships_and_funding/cis/).

Previously, I was a Master's student in the Department of Mathematics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I studied Pure Mathematics. My specialisation was in Algebra and Logic and I was advised by [Chrysostomos Psaroudakis](https://sites.google.com/view/chrysostomos-psaroudakis/home). I received my undergraduate degree (Diploma) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the same university, where I graduated 1st in my class. I pursued my Diploma Thesis on Quantum Cryptography in Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6 (LIP6) of the CNRS and Sorbonne University, where I was supervised by [Alex Bredarior Grilo](https://abgrilo.github.io/).
